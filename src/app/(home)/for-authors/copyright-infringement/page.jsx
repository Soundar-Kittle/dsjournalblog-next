        Any claims of copyright infringement should be addressed to the Editor
        at <b>queries@dsjournals.com</b> bearing the subject line "Copyright
        Infringement". The claim must be sufficed by documented evidence
        supporting the same version as being published or copyrighted or
        patented by the aggrieved party before the date of publication of the
        concerned DS article. On receipt of the claim, the DS Board, if found
        deemed, shall inform the DS author to provide an explanation; the
        discussion of which shall be transparent to both parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        The DS Board reserves the sole rights to decide the validity of any such
        claims. After deliberation, if the claim is found justified, the
        concerned manuscript will be removed from all DS archives and servers.
        Any subsequent print copies of the concerned issue will not contain the
        article. In case, the changes required are minimal such as inclusion of
        references, the authors will be intimated to do the required amendments
        according to the DS article correction policies. The alternative version
        shall undergo peer-review as any other general submission and shall be
        published in the same issue (number) of the concerned volume. Any claims
        on copyright will be addressed with the highest priority. A revert mail
        will be dispatched within 3 working days provided the claim is supported
        with documented evidence.
