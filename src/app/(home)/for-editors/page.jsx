        <h3>Duties and Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>
          Our editorial board members and reviewers must be leaders in their
          fields and have previous experience publishing publications. Because a
          reviewer's opinion determines whether an article is accepted or
          rejected, they play a vital part in the peer-review process. All the
          members are requested to test out the articles submitted to them
          without any bias to increase our journals' quality. There are no hard
          and fast rules for analyzing an article; it all depends on its worth,
          quality, and uniqueness. While verifying the article, keep the
          following aspects in mind.
