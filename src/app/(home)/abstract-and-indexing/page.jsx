        Dream Science’s publications appear in a wide range of abstracting and
        indexing databases. Different journals are listed in different

        Post-publication distribution of your research is one of the most
        important things we do at Dream Science. If your research is not
        discoverable, it cannot advance science, medicine, or society. A lack of
        discoverability has a negative impact on readership and future
        citations.

        <p className="intent-5">
          Many researchers use abstract databases as curated discovery tools.
          These could be general multi-discipline databases such as Google
          scholar, Scopus or Web of Science, where coverage is broad but a
          selection process is employed based on journal quality (the main index
          of Web of Science contains only about 9,000 of the approximately
          28,000 active scholarly peer-reviewed English-language journals).
          There are also subject-specific databases such as Embase (biomedical
          research), INSPEC (physics and engineering) or MEDLINE (medicine).
          These databases select journals based on quality and compatibility
          with their respective scopes.
