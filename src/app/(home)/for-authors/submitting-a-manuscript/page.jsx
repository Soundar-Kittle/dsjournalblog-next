        Summary of Important Items When Submitting a Manuscript
      </h2>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-8">
        <li>
          Make sure your paper has content that is appropriate for the journal.
          Unreviewed publications that are outside of scope will be sent back to
          the writers. Please read the journal's Aim &amp; Scope.
        </li>
        <li>Please read the publishing ethics webpage.</li>
        <li>
          Please include a cover letter outlining the manuscript's significance.
        </li>
        <li>
          The three most crucial screening criteria are believed to be
          correctness, grammar, and spelling. Your text will be returned if it
          has any grammatical or spelling mistakes.
        </li>
        <li>
          At the editor's discretion, manuscripts that do not satisfy the
          novelty, significance, and competence requirements (Aim &amp; Scope of
          the Journal) may be returned to authors at any time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure that figures are properly labeled (with coordinates, a scale
          bar, and an orientation) and that the resolution is acceptable for the
          scale of the publication.
        </li>
        <li>
          Decide whether your article should be a research, application, review,
          or short note (see Aim &amp; Scope of the journal). Make sure your
          text doesn't exceed the word count for the article type you select.
          Note that the maximum word count only considers the text, not the
          abstract, keywords, references, or captions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Address the reviewers' remarks in detail, point by point, if you are
          submitting a revised article. This includes any requests for
          linguistic alterations.
        </li>
        <li>
          The structure of your manuscript must be, in brief:
          <ul className="ml-10">
            <li>
              (a) Word processing format (i.e. MS Word or LaTeX during the
              submission). The amended paper should not be sent as a PDF file.
            </li>
            <li>(b) Single column.</li>
            <li>(c) Double-spaced lines.</li>
            <li>(d) Line numbers.</li>
            <li>(e) Follow the journal's reference format requirements. </li>
            <li>
              (f) separate and correctly labelled figures must be uploaded
              throughout the submission process.
            </li>
            <li>
              (g) At the end of the text document, include a separate list of
              the captions for the figures and tables.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
