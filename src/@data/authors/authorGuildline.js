            If authors are prompted to submit a revised version of their manuscript,
            they must indicate all changes (for example, by using coloured text or the
            track changes feature of their word processing programme) and submit the
            updated version along with a cover letter that includes an itemised response

            non-commercial purposes. Requests for materials must be complied with by

              Continue the main text's sequential numbering if your article includes
              an appendix that contains one or more figures. The appendix figures
              should not be numbered "A1, A2, A3, etc." However, figures in electronic
              appendices (supplemental material) should be given their own numbers.

            </li>

              In bold font, the word "Fig." is used at the start of each figure

              Use boxes, circles, etc., as coordinate points in graphs and list all of
              the figure's components in the caption.

            <li>
              Put a reference citation at the end of the figure caption to indicate

              Information can be conveyed using patterns instead of or in addition to

          To be published online alongside an article or book chapter, DREAM SCIENCE
          welcomes electronic multimedia items (animations, movies, audio, etc.). Due
          to the fact that some information cannot be printed or is more practical in
          electronic form, this function can add depth to the author's piece.
        </p>
        <p>
          Research datasets should be reviewed before being submitted as electronic
          supplementary material. Wherever it is feasible, research data should be
          archived in data repositories.
