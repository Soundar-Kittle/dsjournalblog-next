        <p>
          With the help of our knowledgeable Editors, Dream Science
          International Journals uses a double-blind peer review procedure for
          an efficient evaluation technique. Senior employees who have a
          thorough understanding of the subject matter are in charge of the
          journal's content. With the assistance of internal journal editors,
          several of the portfolio's journals have external Editors-in-Chief.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-8">
          <li>
            Every article is initially evaluated by our editorial staff based on
            its timeliness, the interest and significance of the subject, the
            application of the scientific method, the clarity of the
            presentation (including the level of English), and the relevance to
            readers.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the manuscript is accepted for peer review, members of the
            worldwide Editorial Board of the journal and/or other experts in the
            field will evaluate it.
          </li>
          <li>
            The editorial staff chooses these candidates based on their
            qualifications and reputation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reviewers are expected to declare any possible conflicts of interest
            that would prevent them from giving an objective assessment of an
            article.
          </li>
          <li>
            The peer-review procedure may be single-blinded or double-blinded
            depending on the journal.
          </li>
          <li>
            Peer reviewers fill out a referee report form and give both general
            and detailed feedback to the author as well as general remarks to
            the journal's editor-in-chief(s).
          </li>
          <li>
            Anonymized constructive criticism that might aid authors in
            improving their work is passed (even if the paper is not ultimately
            accepted).
          </li>
          <li>
            If necessary, revised papers can be submitted to additional peer
            review.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Editor-in-Chief of the journal has the final say on whether an
            article should be accepted for publication.
          </li>
          <li>
            Our cascade procedure may be used to suggest an alternate journal to
            evaluate the manuscript if an article is not judged appropriate for
            publishing in the journal to which it is submitted.
          </li>
          <li>
            This review procedure encourages the production of objective,
            factually correct, and topical material.
